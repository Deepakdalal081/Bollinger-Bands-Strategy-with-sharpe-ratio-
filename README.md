**Bollinger Bands Strategy with Sharpe Ratio**
##
Bollinger Bands is a popular technical analysis tool used to identify potential overbought or oversold conditions in the market. The strategy involves three lines:
#
*Middle Band*: The moving average (usually 20-period).<br />
*Upper Band*: Middle Band + (k × Standard Deviation).<br />
*Lower Band*: Middle Band - (k × Standard Deviation).<br />

Here, 
𝑘
k is typically set to 2.<br />
<br />
**Sell Signal:** <br /> When the price crosses above the upper band and then reverses downwards, indicating an overbought condition.

**Sharpe Ratio in Bollinger Band Strategy**

##
The Sharpe Ratio is a performance metric used to evaluate the risk-adjusted return of the strategy:<br /> 

**Sharpe Ratio** = (Average Return − Risk-Free Rate) /  Standard Deviation of Returns <br /> 

The **purpose** is to evaluate whether the returns from the Bollinger Bands strategy sufficiently justify the risks taken.
